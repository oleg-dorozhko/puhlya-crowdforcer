# ─⋆⋅☆⋅⋆── PUHLYA CROWDFORCER #001 ─⋆⋅☆⋅⋆─

**[Recommended flair: Business/Entrepreneurship or Discussion or Startup]**

**the most honest donut in human history**

Imagine a 3×3m kiosk with a huge progress bar across the entire facade:  
**"Currently 55 UAH (~$1.30) — we're paying off the equipment. Once paid off — 25 UAH (~$0.60) forever"**

Everything is open. No secrets. This isn't just donuts.  
This is **nonlinear food crowdforcing**, where customer = investor = winner.

## How it works (full transparency)

| Stage | Price | What happens | Satisfaction effect |
|:-----|:-----|:----------------|:-----------------|
| Days 1–83 (payoff period) | 55-60 UAH | Raising 250,000 UAH (~$6,000) for equipment | Progress bar 0/4545 donuts |
| Every 20,000 UAH revenue | –10% for 3 days | Everyone rushes because "cheaper now than tomorrow" | People accelerate payoff themselves |
| 50% paid off | 40 UAH + promo | "Bring a friend — both get 30 UAH" | Viral growth |
| 90% paid off | 70 UAH (final sprint) | ×4 to personal donation for tier credit | Someone buys 100 to finish it off |
| 100% paid off | **25 UAH forever** | First 3 hours — 10 UAH. Neighborhood celebration | People cry with joy |

**After equipment payoff — stable price 25 UAH (with cost 7 UAH + operational expenses 13 UAH)**

---

## Exclusive loyalty tiers (also nonlinear)

| Spent during payoff period | Tier | Price after payoff |
|:-----------------------------|:-------|:---------------------|
| 500–1,999 UAH | Bronze | 20 UAH (instead of 25) |
| 2,000–4,999 UAH | Silver | 15 UAH |
| 5,000+ UAH | Gold | 10 UAH lifetime + priority in line |
| 15,000+ UAH | Legend | 7 UAH (cost price) + your own flavor forever in menu ("Puhlya u/username") |

## What happens when the equipment wears out? (important explanation)

In 3–7 years the oven or fryer wears out. What then?

→ We do it **AGAIN**, but even better:

1. A new progress bar appears on the facade: **"New Oven 2.0 — raising 400,000 UAH"**
2. Price temporarily rises to 40–50 UAH (still cheaper than market)
3. All previous Legends, Gold, Silver, Bronze — **keep their discounts and lifetime 7–10–15–20 UAH**
4. New round — new Legends, new flavors, new tiers
5. Those who already "invested" earlier — forever in profit and don't pay more

**So equipment changes, but lifetime discount — remains forever.**  
This is honest, transparent, and motivates people to return for years.

## Why donuts > hot dogs, pizza, shawarma

- 100% vegan option automatically
- Zero sanitation problems
- Cosmic margin after payoff (18 UAH per donut at 25 UAH price)
- Lines from 7 AM guaranteed in 6–9 months
- Reviews write themselves: "Invested 15,000 UAH → now eating at 7 UAH for life. Better than a deposit"

## Long-term plan

- **February 2026** — first kiosk (Kyiv/Lviv/Odesa — voting in comments)
- **2027** — network across Ukraine
- **2029** — political party **"Transparent Puhlya"**  
  Slogan: **"We already made donuts for 25 UAH. We'll do the same with everything"**

**Oven already found** (China, 120 donuts/hour, 94,000 UAH)  
**Total investment:** 250,000 UAH (~$6,000) (equipment + startup)

- Design, signs, progress bar: **40,000 UAH**
- Permits, reserve: **36,000 UAH**
- **TOTAL: 250,000 UAH** → ~4,545 donuts at 55 UAH

### Cost of 1 donut after payoff:
```
Product (flour, oil, filling, packaging):    7 UAH
Kiosk rent (per unit):                       3 UAH
Baker wages (2 shifts):                      8 UAH

## P.S. This is more than business — it's a new economic standard

**For political parties that truly want to do something for the people of Ukraine:**

Imagine your party supporting such projects across the country. Not in words — but with real actions:
- Help with permits and bureaucracy
- Consult on legal matters
- Popularize the transparent economy model
- Create open source infrastructure for such businesses

**The result?** Tens of thousands of new voters who **see** how politics works for them:
- Student eats donut for 25 UAH instead of 45 UAH at market = +20 UAH savings daily
- Pensioner-Legend eats free because invested 15k earlier = trust for years
- Entrepreneur sees you can run honest AND profitable business = inspiration

A party that truly wanted to do something for the people of Ukraine, for our country's economy — could support this project. And would be amazed by the number of new voters who would choose the path it proposed.

**This is an example of a general economic scheme:**

"The customer gets a significant discount for choosing our producer. Through transparent cost calculation, they can always verify fair money distribution. There's simply nothing to hide in the cash flows of such a micro-enterprise. Yes, someday we'll replace equipment with new. We'll announce a new fundraiser then for loyal customers. First we pay off the oven. Then we keep prices low. When replacement is needed — we'll definitely raise money for it thanks to you"

**This scheme is healthy and beneficial for the economy. This isn't theory — it's practice that can be replicated.**

Lobby for honesty and openness. Here. Right before your eyes! Why not?
